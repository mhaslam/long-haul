So we read and read and read. Saw videos, checked posts and, at the end we ended up with a list of features we wanted in our bike:

* 26'' Wheels: for strenght, adaptability, and the availabilit of spares.
* steel frame: because, well, just get a steel frame if you are touring.
* simple components: nothing that can't be MacGyvered on the road.
* Confortable: that means good frame dimentions, good seat and confortable handelbars.
* Good for going uphill with weight: that means less than 18 gear inches (26*smallest number of teeth on front gear/largest number of teeth on the back gear).
* ACAP: as cheap as possible

Our budget was 1000Euros, but we soon found out that we couldent get what we wanted for that price
